I'm a backend developer from the Munich region with a passion for streamlined architectures that respect user privacy. My approach combines systematic engineering with hands-on problem-solving, whether I'm developing automation pipelines or prototyping hardware solutions.

**Currently**: Seeking hybrid remote opportunities in backend development, DevOps, or system engineering while developing energy automation solutions and advancing my homelab infrastructure.

## What I'm Working On

- **FeneconPV API Middleware**: Building a custom API layer to integrate Fenecon PV system data with Home Assistant, enabling intelligent energy automation, like automatically switching hot water heating from grid power to surplus solar energy
- **Homelab Evolution**: Transitioning to cluster architecture with Proxmox & NixOS
- **Project Wiki**: Documenting my technical journey and experiments at [https://wiki.organiccircuitlab.com](https://wiki.organiccircuitlab.com/en/im_working_on_it)

## üõ†Ô∏è Featured Project: OpenController

**Universal Smart Home & Maker Control System** - A comprehensive Rust-based control software for debugging MQTT infrastructures, controlling ELRS RC vehicles, and managing various wireless protocols through a unified gamepad interface.

## üíª Tech Stack & Interests

**Languages:** Rust, Python, C++, SQL  
**Favorites:** State Machines, MQTT 
**Focus Areas:** Backend Development, DevOps, Embedded Systems, Automation  
**Tools:** Docker, NixOS,SQLite, Proxmox, WebDAV, Various IoT Protocols

## üå± Philosophy

I treat codebases like gardens - well-planned systems that run smoothly with minimal intervention, but turn chaotic without proper care. My work is driven by a deep dislike of waste - whether it's wasteful code, unnecessary resource consumption, or overcomplicated workflows.
